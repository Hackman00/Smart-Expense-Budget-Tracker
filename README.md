# Smart-Expense-Budget-Tracker
The Smart Expense &amp; Budget Tracker for Individuals is a web or mobile-based system designed to help individuals manage their personal finances in a simple and structured way. The system allows users to track expenses, record income, set budgets, monitor basic investments, and view financial summaries through dashboards and visual reports.

The project focuses on individual personal finance, avoiding complex accounting features, external banking integrations, or advanced AI systems. Instead, it uses rule-based logic and data visualization to provide meaningful insights while remaining technically achievable within a 12-week capstone timeline for a four-person team.
